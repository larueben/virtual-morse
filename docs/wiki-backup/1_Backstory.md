At age 17, [Josh LaRue](http://joshpaullarue.com/) experienced a devastating brain injury. During a severe asthma attack he stopped breathing and was without oxygen for several minutes. The resulting brain injury has drastically impaired his motor skills, vision and speech. He is not paralyzed but is effectively confined to a wheelchair. While he can move his limbs and major muscle groups, his general physical dexterity is quite limited. He is legally blind but does have limited vision. That is, he can see colors, light intensity and movements but it is very blurry to where he cannot read. He has speech but it is very difficult for him to communicate verbally, especially to an untrained ear.  

What Josh hadnâ€™t lost was his intellect, creativity, and drive to keep moving forward.  Josh, along with a brother and friend of the family, created a system for him to communicate using his tongue to activate switches as Morse code input to his computer.  Even at a few words per minute it allows him to clearly communicate what he has to say.  He has since written multiple books.  His first book, _My Last Breath_, tells his story of injury, road to recovery and the development of his communication system (Chapter 27).  This book would be informative for those wanting to better understand his backstory and situation.  Likewise, see the short film documentary of the same title at https://vimeo.com/103768944.

The original Virtual Morse system was conceived of and named by Josh in the mid-1990's. An inventor named Tom in the Cambridge, OH area built the first switch device and helped Josh with some ways to incorporate into a computer.
Jack LaRue developed the original software in collaboration with Josh in the late-90's, with continued imrpovements over the next 15 years. See https://github.com/jackdlarue/virtual-morse

Virtual Morse 2023 was a complete rebuild from scratch to work in a modern Windows environment and provide some much needed improvements. A team of four talented students studying Computer Science at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) took the project on as a Senior Capstone class project.
